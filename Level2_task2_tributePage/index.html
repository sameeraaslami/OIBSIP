            <h2>Why I Admire Marie Curie</h2>
            <p>Marie Curie has been a personal hero of mine since I first learned about her groundbreaking work in science. What makes her truly remarkable isn't just her scientific achievements, but her perseverance against all odds in a time when women were largely excluded from academia and scientific research.</p>
            
            <p>Her dedication to science was absolute, yet she remained humble throughout her life. Despite becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize (and later the first person to win two), she never sought fame or fortune. Instead, she focused on how her discoveries could benefit humanity.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."
            </div>
            
            <p>This quote perfectly encapsulates her approach to science and life - facing the unknown with curiosity rather than fear. Her work with radioactive materials ultimately cost her life, but she pursued it anyway because she believed in the importance of scientific progress.</p>

            <p>Marie Curie's legacy extends far beyond her scientific discoveries. She broke gender barriers in science, proving that women could achieve at the highest levels of academic research. Her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie followed in her footsteps, also winning a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
            
            <p>Today, her name is synonymous with scientific excellence. Numerous institutions bear her name, including the Curie Institute in Paris and Warsaw, and the element curium (atomic number 96) was named in honor of her and Pierre.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps most inspiring is how she used her fame to advance science rather than personal gain. She refused to patent the radium isolation process, wanting it to benefit all of humanity. Even her Nobel Prize medals were donated to war efforts.</p>
